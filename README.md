config
======

My dotfiles, utility scripts, and other config files.


To use, go to your home directory, clone the repo, and run setup.
setup creates symlinks for all dotfiles in the repo's root directory in your home directory.
setup also runs ssh/setup which creates a symlink for ssh/config.

Some user-specific files such as ssh/config will require customization.
